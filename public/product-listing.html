                <div>
                    <p>Technological inventions and developments have created new possibilities and breakthroughs in medical diagnostics offering considerable clinical benefits in a variety of fields, be it radiology, cardiology, neurology, women’s health or osteoarticular systems. Sanrad, very early on recognised the impact of modern medicine more notably in the field of advanced diagnostic techniques through imaging diagnosis.</p>
                    <p>Modern procedures like Computed Tomography and Magnetic Resonance imaging are currently available for clinical diagnosis from reputed imaging equipment manufacturers offered by Sanrad that provides maximum economic value for your investment.</p>

                <div>Computed-Axial Tomography — CT Scanners</div>
                <div>
                        <p>In modern diagnostic medicine, a new technique of computed tomography (CT) reconstructs a cross-sectional image of the body from a ‘virtual pile of X-ray photographs’. A tomographic image is an image of a “slice” through the body. Simultaneous acquisition of several slices results in significantly shortened imaging times and quicker diagnostics.</p>

                        <p>For medical practitioners, structures and lesions associated with patients previously impossible to visualise can now be seen with remarkable clarity with the assistance of CT scanners which is far superior to conventional X-ray imaging.</p>

                <div>Magnetic Resonance Imaging — MRI Scanners</div>
                <div>
                    <p>Innovation has always been a top priority in the development of Magnetic Resonance Imaging scanners. MRI scans are predominantly used as an additional source of information in the diagnosis of arteriovenous malformations (i.e. short circuits, as it could be envisaged, between arteries and veins that may lead to epilepsy or haemorrhages, amongst other things).</p>
                    <p>The history of MRI, in general, has always featured critical scientific innovations developed by researchers and scientists from the world’s leading universities to be of assistance to medical practitioners.</p>
                    <p>Toshiba MR systems include non-contrast imaging applications and Pianissimo acoustic noise reduction technology, resulting in a safer and quieter exam for the patient while the Sina Healthcare systems bring the very latest innovations in diagnostics at an affordable cost to significant hospitals and private diagnostic clinics around the globe.</p>
