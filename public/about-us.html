                        <p>Together, Everyone Achieves More. </p>
                        <p>This is the foundational imprint on which Sanrad has cultivated, fostered and developed integral partner relationships through the years. When it comes to a technology and support partner, commitment is vital, and we’ve been able to nurture a special relationship with Toshiba Medical Systems Corporation, a global leader since the 90s, specialised in the manufacture of diagnostic imaging systems that improves the quality of patient care, everywhere.</p>
                        <p>Our mutual philosophy is in having the “patient” at the heart in everything we do and ably assisting the community at large in contributing to the health and well-being of patients across the country through specialised products and customer-centric services from our chosen partners. </p>
                        <p>We are also proud to be distinguished as a trusted partner for Toshiba and currently house the most extensive inventory for CT Scanner spares for the company’s products both in India and abroad.</p>
